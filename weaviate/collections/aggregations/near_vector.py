        """Aggregate metrics over the objects returned by a near vector search on this collection.

        At least one of `certainty`, `distance`, or `object_limit` must be specified here for the vector search.

        This method requires that the objects in the collection have associated vectors.

        Arguments:
            `near_vector`
                The vector to search on.
            `certainty`
                The minimum certainty of the vector search.
            `distance`
                The maximum distance of the vector search.
            `object_limit`
                The maximum number of objects to return from the vector search prior to the aggregation.
            `filters`
                The filters to apply to the search.
            `group_by`
                How to group the aggregation by.
            `total_count`
                Whether to include the total number of objects that match the query in the response.
            `return_metrics`
                A list of property metrics to aggregate together after the text search.

        Returns:
            Depending on the presence of the `group_by` argument, either a `AggregateReturn` object or a `AggregateGroupByReturn that includes the aggregation objects.

        Raises:
            `weaviate.exceptions.WeaviateQueryError`:
                If an error occurs while performing the query against Weaviate.
            `weaviate.exceptions.WeaviateInvalidInputError`:
                If any of the input arguments are of the wrong type.
