        """Aggregate metrics over all the objects in this collection using the hybrid algorithm blending keyword-based BM25 and vector-based similarity.

        Arguments:
            `query`
                The keyword-based query to search for, REQUIRED. If query and vector are both None, a normal search will be performed.
            `alpha`
                The weight of the BM25 score. If not specified, the default weight specified by the server is used.
            `vector`
                The specific vector to search for. If not specified, the query is vectorized and used in the similarity search.
            `query_properties`
                The properties to search in. If not specified, all properties are searched.
            `object_limit`
                The maximum number of objects to return from the hybrid vector search prior to the aggregation.
            `filters`
                The filters to apply to the search.
            `group_by`
                How to group the aggregation by.
            `total_count`
                Whether to include the total number of objects that match the query in the response.
            `return_metrics`
                A list of property metrics to aggregate together after the text search.

        Returns:
            Depending on the presence of the `group_by` argument, either a `AggregateReturn` object or a `AggregateGroupByReturn that includes the aggregation objects.

        Raises:
            `weaviate.exceptions.WeaviateQueryError`:
                If an error occurs while performing the query against Weaviate.
            `weaviate.exceptions.WeaviateInvalidInputError`:
                If any of the input arguments are of the wrong type.
