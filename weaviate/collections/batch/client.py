        Add one object to this batch.

        NOTE: If the UUID of one of the objects already exists then the existing object will be
        replaced by the new object.

        Arguments:
            `collection`
                The name of the collection this object belongs to.
            `properties`
                The data properties of the object to be added as a dictionary.
            `uuid`:
                The UUID of the object as an uuid.UUID object or str. It can be a Weaviate beacon or Weaviate href.
                If it is None an UUIDv4 will generated, by default None
            `vector`:
                The embedding of the object that should be validated. Can be used when a collection does not have a vectorization module or the given vector was generated using the _identical_ vectorization module that is configured for the class. In this case this vector takes precedence. Supported types are `list`, 'numpy.ndarray`, `torch.Tensor` and `tf.Tensor`, by default None.
            `tenant`
                Name of the tenant.

        Returns:
            `str`
                The UUID of the added object. If one was not provided a UUIDv4 will be auto-generated for you and returned here.

        Raises:
            `WeaviateBatchValidationError`
                If the provided options are in the format required by Weaviate.
