    """
    A python native weaviate Client class that encapsulates Weaviate functionalities in one object.
    A Client instance creates all the needed objects to interact with Weaviate, and connects all of
    them to the same Weaviate instance. See below the Attributes of the Client instance. For the
    per attribute functionality see that attribute's documentation.

    Attributes
    ----------
    backup : weaviate.backup.Backup
        A Backup object instance connected to the same Weaviate instance as the Client.
    batch : weaviate.batch.Batch
        A Batch object instance connected to the same Weaviate instance as the Client.
    classification : weaviate.classification.Classification
        A Classification object instance connected to the same Weaviate instance as the Client.
    contextionary : weaviate.contextionary.Contextionary
        A Contextionary object instance connected to the same Weaviate instance as the Client.
    data_object : weaviate.date.DataObject
        A DataObject object instance connected to the same Weaviate instance as the Client.
    schema : weaviate.schema.Schema
        A Schema object instance connected to the same Weaviate instance as the Client.
    query : weaviate.gql.Query
        A Query object instance connected to the same Weaviate instance as the Client.

        Initialize a Client class instance.

        Parameters
        ----------
        url : str
            The URL to the weaviate instance.
        auth_client_secret : weaviate.AuthCredentials or None, optional
            Authenticate to weaviate by using one of the given authentication modes:
            - weaviate.auth.AuthBearerToken to use existing access and (optionally, but recommended) refresh tokens
            - weaviate.auth.AuthClientPassword to use username and password for oidc Resource Owner Password flow
            - weaviate.auth.AuthClientCredentials to use a client secret for oidc client credential flow
        timeout_config : tuple(Real, Real) or Real, optional
            Set the timeout configuration for all requests to the Weaviate server. It can be a
            real number or, a tuple of two real numbers: (connect timeout, read timeout).
            If only one real number is passed then both connect and read timeout will be set to
            that value, by default (2, 20).
        proxies : dict, str or None, optional
            Proxies to be used for requests. Are used by both 'requests' and 'aiohttp'. Can be
            passed as a dict ('requests' format:
            https://docs.python-requests.org/en/stable/user/advanced/#proxies), str (HTTP/HTTPS
            protocols are going to use this proxy) or None.
            By default None.
        trust_env : bool, optional
            Whether to read proxies from the ENV variables: (HTTP_PROXY or http_proxy, HTTPS_PROXY
            or https_proxy). By default False.
            NOTE: 'proxies' has priority over 'trust_env', i.e. if 'proxies' is NOT None,
            'trust_env' is ignored.
        additional_headers : dict or None
            Additional headers to include in the requests.
            Can be used to set OpenAI/HuggingFace keys. OpenAI/HuggingFace key looks like this:
                {"X-OpenAI-Api-Key": "<THE-KEY>"}, {"X-HuggingFace-Api-Key": "<THE-KEY>"}
            by default None
