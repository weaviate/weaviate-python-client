The Python client makes it easy to work with `Weaviate <https://weaviate.io/>`_. The client is tested for python 3.8 and higher.

There are two versions of the Weaviate Python client. The latest version, v4, is redesigned to take advantage of a faster query interface and offers improved programming features. For more information, see:

- `Python Client v4 overview <https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/python>`_
- `Python Client v3 overview <https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/python_v3>`_
