Version 4.4.0
--------------

This version is the first full release for the Python v4 client and _requires_  weaviate versions >= 1.23.7.

Since the previous RC, there have been a number of improvements and final bug fixes.
- The type of ``object.vector`` has changed from ``Optional[Dict[str, List[float]]]`` to ``Dict[str, List[float]]`` so that ``object.vector`` is never ``None``.
- Exporting and importing of collections has been tidied up and improved.
- A number of methods have had input validation added to them.
- Most exceptions are now unified under a few common classes.

For more information around the new client, see here: https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/python


Version 4.4.rc1
--------------

This version is a release candidate for the python v4 client.

There is a significant breaking change in this version in anticipation of the named vectors functionality of future Weaviate versions.
- The ``vector`` property of ``Object`` has had its type changed from ``Optional[List[float]]`` to ``Optional[Dict[str, List[float]]]``.
- Accessing of the vector property has changed from ``object.vector`` to ``object.vector["default"]``.
- When using the client with future releases, other named vectors will be accessible as ``object.vector["name"]``.

Newly created (as of 15:00UTC 01/30/24) WCS sandbox instances are now capable of handling gRPC connections and so the client has been updated accordingly in its ``connect_to_wcs`` method.
If you are using an old sandbox, make a new one and use the new one instead.

Minor bugfixes are also included.


Version 4.4.rc0
--------------

This version is a release candidate for the python v4 client.

All backward compatibility code is being removed and _requires_  weaviate versions >= 1.23.5.

All deprecated code has been removed. Check the migration guide (https://www.weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/python#migration-guides) how to update your code.

Improvements include:
- Input validation
- Embedded weaviate shows an error when the chosen port(s) are already occupied

Fixes include:
- Filter chained references by reference count
- Various bug with filtered aggregation
- Aggregation with move to/away_from objects
- Timeouts also apply to GRPC calls



Version 4.4.b9
--------------

This beta version has breaking changes, a migration guide is available at https://www.weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/python#migration-guides:

- The batching algorithm has been streamlined and improved in its implementation and API surface.
    - There are now three types of batching that can be performed:
        - ``client.batch.dynamic()`` where the algorithm will automatically determine the optimal batch size and number of concurrent requests.
        - ``client.batch.fixed_size()`` where the user can specify the batch size and number of concurrent requests.
        - ``client.batch.rate_limit()`` where the user specifies the number of requests per minute that their third-party vectorization API can support.
    - If an exception is thrown in the background batching thread then this is surfaced to the main thread and re-raised in order to stop the batch.
        - Previously, this would silently error.
- Enforces that all optional arguments to queries must be supplied as keyword arguments.
- Adds runtime validation to all queries.
- Renaming of ``prop`` to ``name`` in ``Filter.by_property``.
- Moving of the ``timeout`` argument in ``weaviate.connect_to_x`` methods into new argument ``additional_config: Optional[AdditionalConfig]``.

Improvements include:
- Introduction of the ``.by_ref_count()`` method on ``Filter`` to filter on the number of references present in a reference property of an object.
    - This was previously achievable with ``Filter([refProp]).greater_than(0)`` but is now more explicit using the chaining syntax.
- The syntax for sorting now feels similar to the new filtering syntax.
    - Supports method chaining like ``Sort.by_property(prop).by_creation_time()`` which will apply the sorting in the order they are chained, i.e., this chain
    is equivalent to the previous syntax of ``[Sort(prop), Sort("_creationTimeUnix")]``.

Fixes include:
- The potential for deadlocks and data races when batching has been reduced.
- Fixes a number of missing properties and poor docstrings in ``weaviate.connect_to_x`` methods.
- Adds the missing ``offset`` parameter to all queries.

Version 4.4.b8
--------------

This beta version has breaking changes, a migration guide is available at https://www.weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/python#migration-guides:

- Filters have been reworked and have a new syntax.
    - Coming from <=4.4.b6 you can replace:
        - ``Filter(path=property)`` with ``Filter.by_property(property)``
        - ``Filter(path=["ref","target_class", "target_property"])`` with ``Filter.by_ref("ref").by_property("target_property")``
        - ``FilterMetadata.ByXX``with ``Filter.by_id/creation_time/update_time()``
    - Coming from =4.4b7 you can replace:
        -  ``Filter.by_ref().link_on("ref").by_property("target_property")`` with ``Filter.by_ref("ref").by_property("target_property")``

Bugfixes include:
- Error message when creating the client directly without calling ``connect_to_XXX``.
- Fix deadlock in new batching algorithm.
- Fix ``skip_init_checks=True`` resulting in compatibility with Weaviate 1.22 only.

Version 4.4.b7
--------------

This beta version has breaking changes, a migration guide is available at https://www.weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/python#migration-guides:

- For ``client.batch`` the ``add_reference`` method was revised. The ``to_object_collection`` parameter was removed and the other parameters were harmonized with ``collection.batch``. Available parameters are now: ``from_uuid``, ``from_collection``, ``from_property``, ``to`` and ``tenant``.
- It is no longer possible to use ``client.batch`` directly, you must use it as a context manager (``with client.batch as batch``)
- Manual batch mode has been removed.
- Dynamic batching (for batch_size and number of concurrent requests) is now default. Fixed-size batching can be configured with ``batch.configure_fixed_size(..)``.
- Filters have been reworked and have a new syntax. You can replace:
    - ``Filter(path=property)`` with ``Filter.by_property(property)``
    - ``Filter(path=["ref","target_class", "target_property"])`` with ``Filter.by_ref().link_on("ref").by_property("target_property")``
    - ``FilterMetadata.ByXX``with ``Filter.by_id/creation_time/update_time()``
- Importing directly from ``weaviate`` has been deprecated. Use ``import weaviate.classes as wvc`` instead and import from there.
- Multi-target references functions have been moved to:
    - ``ReferenceProperty.MultiTarget``
    - ``DataReference.MultiTarget``
    - ``QueryReference.MultiTarget``
- Exception names are now compatible with PEP8, old names are still available but deprecated.
- References can now be provided directly as ``UUIDs``, ``str`` and ``Reference.XXX()`` has been deprecated. For multi-target references use ``ReferenceToMulti``.

New functionality includes:
- New batching algorithm that supports dynamic scaling of batch-size and number of concurrent requests.
- New filter syntax that also supports structured filtering on references for normal properties and metadata.
- All reference functions have unified input formats and now accept ``UUID``, ``str`` and (where applicable) ``List[str]``, ``List[UUID]``.
- Returned types are now available in ``weaviate.output``.
- Add missing classes to ``weaviate.classes``.
- Add missing parameters to ``connect_to_XXX``, all functions should support skipping of init checks and auth.
- The client can now be used in a context manager ``with connect_to_XX(..) as client`` and all connections will be closed when exiting the manager.
- New close function ``client.close()`` that needs to be called when not using a context manager to avoid stale connections and potential memory leaks.
- Support for ``Phonenumber`` datatype.
- Referenced objects now contain the name of their collection.
- Adds ``collection.config.update_shards()``.

Bugfixes include:
- object.reference is empty instead of None, if an object does not have a reference.
- Fixes creating backups on weaviate master.
- Add missing classes to ``wvc``.

New client usage:
- Client as a context manager:
    .. code-block:: python
        with weaviate.connect_to_local() as client:
            # Your code
- Client without a context manager:
    .. code-block:: python
        try:
            client = weaviate.connect_to_local()
            # Your code
        finally:
            client.close()

Version 4.4.b6
--------------

This beta version includes:

- A fix to the ``_Property`` dataclass returned within ``collection.config.get()`` to include any ``nested_properties`` of ``object`` and ``object[]`` type properties
- Fix batch inserts with empty lists

Version 4.4.b5
--------------

This beta version includes:

- |
    Adds new :class:`~weaviate.client.Client` credential OIDC flow method:

        .. code-block:: python

            client_credentials_config = weaviate.AuthClientCredentials(
                client_secret = "client_secret",
                scope = "scope1 scope2" # optional, depends on the configuration of your identity provider
            )

Version 3.9.0
-------------
This minor version includes:


- Authentication using Bearer token, by adding ``additional_headers`` to the :class:`~weaviate.client.Client` initialization:
    .. code-block:: python

        client = weaviate.Client(
            url='http://localhost:8080',
            additional_headers={
                {"authorization": "Bearer <MY_TOKEN>"}
            }
        )

- Multi-threading :class:`~weaviate.batch.Batch`  import:
    - |
        Now it is possible to import data using multi-threading. The number of threads can be set using the new argument ``num_workers`` in
        :meth:`~weaviate.batch.Batch.configure` and :meth:`~weaviate.batch.Batch.__call__`, defaults to `1` ( Use with care to not overload your weaviate instance.).
    - |
        New argument ``connection_error_retries`` to retry on ``ConnectionError`` that can be set in :meth:`~weaviate.batch.Batch.configure` and :meth:`~weaviate.batch.Batch.__call__`
        or using the property getter/setter: ``client.batch.connection_error_retries`` to get the value and ``client.batch.connection_error_retries = 5`` to set the value.
    - |
        New method :meth:`~weaviate.batch.Batch.start` to create a ``BatchExecutor`` (``ThreadExecutor``). This method does NOT need to be called if using the
        :class:`~weaviate.batch.Batch` in a context manager (``with``). Also it is idempotent.
    - |
        New method :meth:`~weaviate.batch.Batch.shutdown` to shutdown the existing ``BatchExecutor`` (``ThreadExecutor``) to release any resources that it is holding once the
        batch import is done. This method does NOT need to be called if using the :class:`~weaviate.batch.Batch` in a context manager (``with``). Also it is idempotent.

- New :class:`~weaviate.client.Client` attribute :class:`~weaviate.cluster.Cluster` to check the status of the cluster nodes.
    - The method :meth:`~weaviate.cluster.Cluster.get_nodes_status` returns the status of each node as a list of dictionaries.
        .. code-block:: python

            client.cluster.get_nodes_status()

- Fix for :meth:`~weaviate.data.DataObject.replace` and :meth:`~weaviate.data.DataObject.update` when using with Weaviate server ``>=v1.14.0``.

- New default ``timeout_config``: ``(10, 60)``.

Version 3.8.0
-------------
This minor version includes:

- Backup functionalities (:class:`~weaviate.backup.Backup`):
    - :meth:`~weaviate.backup.Backup.create` method to create backups (all/subset of classes).
    - :meth:`~weaviate.backup.Backup.get_create_status` method to get the status of the created backup.
    - :meth:`~weaviate.backup.Backup.restore` method to restore Weaviate from a backup (all/subset of classes).
    - :meth:`~weaviate.backup.Backup.get_restore_status` method to get the status of the restored backup.
- New :class:`~weaviate.Client` attribute: ``backup`` to ``create``, ``restore`` and ``get status`` of the backups. All backup operations MUST be done through ``Client.backup``.
- Added return value for :meth:`~weaviate.batch.Batch.add_data_object`, it now returns the UUID of the added object, if one was not set then an UUIDv4 will be generated.

Version 3.7.0
-------------
This minor version includes:

- Adds rolling average (last 5 batches) for batch creation time used by Dynamic Batching method.
- Adds ability to use :meth:`~weaviate.gql.Query.get` without specifying any properties IF Additional Properties (:meth:`~weaviate.gql.get.GetBuilder.with_additional`) are set before executing the query.
- Adds base Weaviate Exception :class:`~weaviate.exceptions.WeaviateBaseError`.
- Adds ability to set proxies. Can be set at :class:`~weaviate.client.Client` initialization by using the new ``proxies`` or ``trust_env`` arguments.
- :class:`~weaviate.batch.crud_batch.Batch` creates UUIDs (UUIDv4) for all added objects that do not have one at client side (fixes data duplication on Batch retries).
- Adds new methods for :class:`~weaviate.wcs.WCS` for instances that have authentication enabled:
    - :meth:`~weaviate.wcs.WCS.get_users_of_cluster` to get users (emails) for all the users that have access to the created Weaviate instance.
    - :meth:`~weaviate.wcs.WCS.add_user_to_cluster` to add users (email) to the created Weaviate instance.
    - :meth:`~weaviate.wcs.WCS.remove_user_from_cluster` to remove user (email) from the created Weaviate instance.

Version 3.6.0
-------------
This minor version includes:

- New function in :func:`~weaviate.util.check_batch_result` used to print errors from batch creation.

- New function argument ``class_name`` for :func:`~weaviate.util.generate_local_beacon`, used ONLY with Weaviate Server version >= ``1.14.0``
    (defaults to ``None`` for backwards compatibility).

- | :func:`~weaviate.util.check_batch_result` is the default ``callback`` function for :class:`~weaviate.batch.Batch`
    (:meth:`~weaviate.batch.Batch.configure` and :meth:`~weaviate.batch.Batch.__call__`) (instead of ``None``).

- | New method argument ``to_object_class_name``  for :meth:`~weaviate.batch.Batch.add_reference`, used ONLY with Weaviate Server version >= ``1.14.0``
    (defaults to ``None`` for backwards compatibility).

- Support for ``distance`` in GraphQL filters (only with Weaviate server >= ``1.14.0``).

- For :class:`~weaviate.data.DataObject`:
    - | New method argument ``class_name`` for :meth:`~weaviate.data.DataObject.get_by_id`, :meth:`~weaviate.data.DataObject.get`, :meth:`~weaviate.data.DataObject.delete`
        :meth:`~weaviate.data.DataObject.exists`, used ONLY with Weaviate Server version >= ``1.14.0`` (defaults to ``None`` for backwards compatibility).
    - Deprecation Warning if Weaviate Server version >= 1.14.0 and ``class_name`` is ``None`` OR if Weaviate Server version < 1.14.0 and ``class_name`` is NOT ``None``.

- For :class:`~weaviate.data.references.Reference`:
    - | New method arguments ``from_class_name`` and ``to_class_name`` (``to_class_names`` for :meth:`~weaviate.data.references.Reference.update`) for
        :meth:`~weaviate.data.references.Reference.add`, :meth:`~weaviate.data.references.Reference.delete`,
        :meth:`~weaviate.data.references.Reference.update`, used ONLY with Weaviate Server version >= ``1.14.0`` (defaults to ``None`` for backwards compatibility).
    - Deprecation Warning if Weaviate Server version >= 1.14.0 and ``class_name`` is ``None`` OR if Weaviate Server version < 1.14.0 and ``class_name`` is NOT ``None``.


Version 3.5.1
-------------
This patch version fixes:

- | the `rerank` not being set bug in :meth:`~weaviate.gql.get.GetBuilder.with_ask`.

- | the bug when using double quotes(`"`) in `question` field in :meth:`~weaviate.gql.get.GetBuilder.with_ask`.

- | the bug where `nearText` filter checks for objects in `moveXXX` clause but never sets it.


Version 3.5.0
-------------
This minor version contains functionality for the new features introduced in Weaviate ``v1.13.0``.

- | New :class:`~weaviate.batch.Batch` method :meth:`~weaviate.batch.Batch.delete_objects` to delete all objects that match a particular expression (``where`` filter).

- | New :class:`~weaviate.gql.get.GetBuilder` method :meth:`~weaviate.gql.get.GetBuilder.with_sort` that allows sorting data on a particular field/s.

- | New :class:`~weaviate.gql.aggregate.AggregateBuilder` method :meth:`~weaviate.gql.aggregate.AggregateBuilder.with_near_text` that allows to
    aggregate data that is matching ``nearText`` filter.

- | New :class:`~weaviate.gql.aggregate.AggregateBuilder` method :meth:`~weaviate.gql.aggregate.AggregateBuilder.with_near_object` that allows to
    aggregate data that is matching ``nearObject`` filter.

- | New :class:`~weaviate.gql.aggregate.AggregateBuilder` method :meth:`~weaviate.gql.aggregate.AggregateBuilder.with_near_vector` that allows to
    aggregate data that is matching ``nearVector`` filter.

Version 3.4.2
-------------
| This patch version fixes another bug in :meth:`~weaviate.data.DataObject.exists`.

Version 3.4.1
-------------
| This patch version fixes bug in :meth:`~weaviate.data.DataObject.exists`.

Version 3.4.0
-------------
| This minor version fixes the bug in setting the Schema's ``invertedIndexConfig`` field.

| New method :meth:`~weaviate.schema.Schema.get_class_shards` to get all shards configuration of a particular class.

| New method :meth:`~weaviate.schema.Schema.update_class_shard` to update one/all shard/s configuration of a particular class.

| Support for new Property field: ``tokenization``.

Version 3.3.3
-------------
| This patch version fixes the nearImage filter requests.

Version 3.3.2
-------------
| This patch version allows using UUIDs in hex format for :class:`~weaviate.data.DataObject` too i.e. UUIDs without hyphens.

Version 3.3.1
-------------
| This patch version allows using UUIDs in hex format too i.e. UUIDs without hyphens.

Version 3.3.0
-------------
| This minor version adds a new :meth:`~weaviate.gql.get.GetBuilder.with_offset` for the ``Get`` queries. This method should be used
    with the :meth:`~weaviate.gql.get.GetBuilder.with_limit`. This new feature (introduced in weaviate version ``1.8.0``) allows to
    use pagination functionality with the ``Get`` queries. The ``offset`` represents the start index of the objects to be returned,
    and the number of objects is specified by the :meth:`~weaviate.gql.get.GetBuilder.with_limit` method.

| For example, to list the
    first ten results, set ``limit: 10``. Then, to "display the second page of 10", set ``offset: 10, limit: 10`` and so on. E.g.
    to show the 9th page of 10 results, set ``offset: 80, limit: 10`` to effectively display results 81-90.

Version 3.2.5
-------------
This patch fixes the ``'Batch' object is not callable`` error.

Version 3.2.4
-------------
| All ``class_name`` and cross-refs ``dataType`` are implicitly capitalized. (This functionality is added because if ``class_name`` is not capitalized
    then Weaviate server does it for you, and this was leading to errors where the client and server have different configurations.)

Fixes/updates in :class:`~weaviate.schema.Schema` class:

- | This patch fixes the :meth:`~weaviate.schema.Schema.contains` to accept separate class schemas as argument
    i.e. it does not expect to have only this format: ``{"classes": [CLASS_1, CLASS_2, ...]}``; now it is possible to pass just ``CLASS_X`` as well.

Version 3.2.3
-------------
This patch fixes the :meth:`~weaviate.gql.get.GetBuilder.with_near_object`. It uses now explicit string literals for ``id``/``beacon`` in `nearoOject` clauses.

Version 3.2.2
-------------
This patch adds support for `array` data types: ``boolean[]``, ``date[]``.

Version 3.2.1
-------------
This patch adds support for `array` data types: ``int[]``, ``number[]``, ``text[]``, ``string[]``.

Version 3.2.0
-------------

Fixes/updates in :class:`~weaviate.wcs.WCS` class:

- Fixed progress bar for :meth:`~weaviate.wcs.WCS.create`, it is being updated in Notebooks too, instead of printing each iteration on new line.
- Method :meth:`~weaviate.wcs.WCS.create` now prints the creation status above the bar.

Updates in :mod:`~weaviate.gql` sub-package:

- | New key-value ``autocorrect: <bool>`` introduced for the :class:`~weaviate.gql.filter.NearText` and :class:`~weaviate.gql.filter.Ask` filters.
    The ``autocorrect`` is enabled only if Weaviate server has the ``text-spellcheck`` module enabled. If ``autocorrect`` is ``True`` the query is
    corrected before the query is made. Usage example:

.. code-block:: python

    # with 'nearText' filter
    client.query\
        .get('Article', ['title', 'author'])\
        .near_text(
            {
                'concepts': ['Ecconomy'],
                'autocorrect': True
            }
        )
        # the concept should be corrected to 'Economy'
    # with 'ask' filter
    client.query\
        .get('Article', ['title', 'author'])\
        .with_ask(
            {
                'question': 'When was the last financial crysis?',
                'autocorrect': True
            }
        )
        # the question should be corrected to 'When was the last financial crisis?'

- | New method :meth:`~weaviate.gql.get.GetBuilder.with_additional` is added to GET the `_additional` properties. Usage example:

.. code-block:: python

    # single additional property with this GraphQL query
    '''
    {
        Get {
            Article {
                title
                author
                _additional {
                    id
                }
            }
        }
    }
    '''
    client.query\
        .get('Article', ['title', 'author'])\
        .with_additional('id') # argument as `str`

    # multiple additional property with this GraphQL query
    '''
    {
        Get {
            Article {
                title
                author
                _additional {
                    id
                    certainty
                }
            }
        }
    }
    '''
    client.query\
        .get('Article', ['title', 'author'])\
        .with_additional(['id', 'certainty']) # argument as `List[str]`

    # additional properties as clause with this GraphQL query
    '''
    {
        Get {
            Article {

Version 3.1.1
-------------

- Fixes in :class:`~weaviate.wcs.WCS` class:
    - | Make :class:`~weaviate.wcs.WCS`'s methods' argument ``cluster_name`` case insensitive (lowercased inside the method) to match Weaviate Cloud Service'
        naming convention, this fixes the error when Weaviate Cloud Service lowercases the ``cluster_name`` but the users are not aware of this and get the exception
        `KeyError`.

Version 3.1.0
-------------

- New :class:`~weaviate.batch.Batch` methods:
    - | :meth:`~weaviate.batch.Batch.pop_object` / :meth:`~weaviate.batch.Batch.pop_reference` to remove and return an added object/reference
        from the :class:`~weaviate.batch.Batch` at position ``index`` (by default ``-1``).
    - |  :meth:`~weaviate.batch.Batch.empty_objects` / :meth:`~weaviate.batch.Batch.empty_references` to remove all the existing objects/references
        from the :class:`~weaviate.batch.Batch` instance.
    - |  :meth:`~weaviate.batch.Batch.is_empty_objects` / :meth:`~weaviate.batch.Batch.is_empty_references` to check there are any objects/references
        in the :class:`~weaviate.batch.Batch` instance.
- Fixes in :class:`~weaviate.wcs.WCS` class:
    - Authentication only with :class:`~weaviate.auth.AuthClientPassword`.
    - | The :meth:`~weaviate.wcs.WCS.create` argument ``module`` is renamed to ``modules`` and can also be a list of modules to enable for the WCS cluster.
        The argument can be used on the `PROD <https://console.semi.technology/>`_ WCS too.
    - The :meth:`~weaviate.wcs.WCS.get_cluster_config` does not raise an exception if the cluster does not exist but returns a empty configuration.
    - The :meth:`~weaviate.wcs.WCS.delete_cluster` does not raise an exception if the cluster does not exist.

- Add ``phoneNumber`` to the Weaviate's primitive types. Thanks to GitHub user `@cdpierse <https://github.com/cdpierse>`_.
- Bug fix in :class:`~weaviate.connect.Connection`.
- Fix ``ConnectionError`` handling.
- Optimization in ``weaviate.batch.requests`` and ``weaviate.connect.connection``.


Version 3.0.0
-------------

- ``weaviate.tools`` module is REMOVED.
    - ``Batcher`` class is REMOVED.
    - ``WCS`` class is moved from the ``weaviate.tools`` to the new module ``weaviate.wcs``
    - ``weaviate.tools.generate_uuid`` is REMOVED.
- :func:`weaviate.util.generate_uuid5` is ADDED.
- | New :class:`~weaviate.batch.Batch` class implementation to replace the old one. This implementation uses the ``BatchRequest``
    objects under the hood, which means that there is no need to create ``BatchRequest``'s anymore. This new class implementation
    allows 3 different batch creations methods: `manual`, `auto-create` and `auto-create` with dynamic batching.
    See the :class:`~weaviate.batch.Batch` documentation for more information.
- | ``BatchRequest`` classes (``ObjectsBatchRequest`` and ``ReferenceBatchRequest``) are hidden from the user and should not be
    used anymore. This is due to the new :class:`~weaviate.batch.Batch` class implementation.
- | New :class:`~weaviate.schema.Schema` field is ADDED, `"shardingConfig"`. It can bu used with Weaviate version >= 1.6.0.
- | New method :meth:`~weaviate.schema.Schema.update_config` used to update mutable schema configuration (like `efConstruction`, ...).
